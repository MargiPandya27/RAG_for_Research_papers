Results on Cityscapes testing set. Methods trained using both ﬁne and coarse data are marked with ‘‡’. in different seasons. The images are divided into sets with numbers 2,975, 500, and 1,525 for training, validation and testing. It deﬁnes 19 categories containing both stuff and objects. Also, 20,000 coarsely annotated images are pro- vided for two settings in comparison, i.e., training with only ﬁne data or with both the ﬁne and coarse data. Methods trained using both ﬁne and coarse data are marked with ‘‡’. Detailed results are listed in Table 7. Our base model is ResNet101 as in DeepLab for
