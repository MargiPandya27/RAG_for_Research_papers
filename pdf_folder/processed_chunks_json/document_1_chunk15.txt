we conduct experiments for different depths of pre-trained ResNet. We test four depths of {50, 101, 152, 269}. As shown in Fig. 5, with the same setting, increasing the depth of ResNet from 50 to 269 can improve the score of (Mean IoU + Pixel Acc.) / 2 (%) from 60.86 to 62.35, with 1.49 ab- solute improvement. Detailed scores of PSPNet pre-trained from different depth ResNet models are listed in Table 3.

Detailed analysis of our proposed PSPNet with compar- ison with others. Our results are obtained on the validation set with the single-scale input except for the last row. Results of FCN, SegNet and DilatedNet are reported in . ‘DA’ refers to data augmentation we performed, ‘AL’ denotes the auxiliary loss we added and ‘PSP’ represents the proposed PSPNet. ‘MS’ means that multi-scale testing is used.

Results of ImageNet scene parsing challenge 2016. The best entry of each team is listed. The ﬁnal score is the mean of Mean IoU and Pixel Acc. Results are evaluated on the testing set. More Detailed Performance Analysis We show our more detailed analysis on the validation set of ADE20K in Table 4. All our results except the last-row one use single- scale test. “ResNet269+DA+AL+PSP+MS” uses multi- scale testing. Our baseline is adapted from ResNet50 with dilated network, which yields MeanIoU 34.28 and Pixel Acc. 76.35.
