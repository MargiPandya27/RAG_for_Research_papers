receive the highest accuracy. Intriguingly, our PSP- Net trained with only VOC 2012 data outperforms existing trained with the MS-COCO pre-trained model. One may argue that our based classiﬁcation model is more powerful than several prior methods since ResNet was recently proposed. To exhibit our unique contribu- tion, we show that our method also outperforms state- of-the-art frameworks that use the same model, including FCRNs , LRR , and DeepLab . In this process, we even do not employ time-consuming but effective post- processing, such as CRF, as that in . Several examples are shown in Fig. 7. For “cows” in row one, our baseline model treats it as “horse” and “dog” while PSPNet corrects these errors. For “aeroplane” and “table” in the second and third rows, PSPNet ﬁnds missing parts. For “person”, “bottle” and “plant” in following rows, PSP- Net performs well on these small-size-object classes in the images compared to the baseline model. More visual com- parisons between PSPNet and other methods are included in Fig. 9. 5.4. Cityscapes Cityscapes is a recently released dataset for semantic urban scene understanding. It contains 5,000 high quality pixel-level ﬁnely annotated images collected from 50 cities 2http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/anonymous/0OOWLP.html 3http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/anonymous/6KIR41.html Method aero bike bird boat bottle bus car cat chair cow table dog horse mbike person plant sheep sofa train tv mIoU FCN 76.8 34.2 68.9 49.4 60.3 75.3 74.7 77.6 21.4 62.5 46.8 71.8 63.9 76.5 73.9 45.2 72.4 37.4 70.9 55.1 62.2 Zoom-out 85.6 37.3 83.2 62.5 66.0 85.1 80.7 84.9 27.2 73.2 57.5 78.1 79.2 81.1 77.1 53.6 74.0 49.2 71.7 63.3 69.6 DeepLab 84.4 54.5 81.5 63.6 65.9 85.1 79.1 83.4 30.7 74.1 59.8 79.0 76.1 83.2 80.8 59.7 82.2 50.4 73.1 63.7 71.6 CRF-RNN 87.5 39.0 79.7 64.2 68.3 87.6 80.8 84.4 30.4 78.2 60.4 80.5 77.8 83.1
