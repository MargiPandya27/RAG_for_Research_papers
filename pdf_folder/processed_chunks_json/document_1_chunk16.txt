Performance Analysis We show our more detailed analysis on the validation set of ADE20K in Table 4. All our results except the last-row one use single- scale test. “ResNet269+DA+AL+PSP+MS” uses multi- scale testing. Our baseline is adapted from ResNet50 with dilated network, which yields MeanIoU 34.28 and Pixel Acc. 76.35. It already outperforms other prior systems pos- sibly due to the powerful ResNet . Our proposed architecture makes further improvement compared to the baseline. Using data augmentation, our result exceeds the baseline by 1.54/0.72 and reaches 35.82/77.07. Using the auxiliary loss can further improve it by 1.41/0.94 and reaches 37.23/78.01. With PSPNet, we notice relatively more signiﬁcant progress for improvement of 4.45/2.03. The result reaches 41.68/80.04. The differ- ence from the baseline result is 7.40/3.69 in terms of abso- lute improvement and 21.59/4.83 (%) in terms of relativity. A deeper network of ResNet269 yields even higher perfor- mance up to 43.81/80.88. Finally, the multi-scale testing scheme moves the scores to 44.94/81.69. in Challenge Using the proposed architecture, our team came in the 1st place in ImageNet scene parsing Figure 6. Visual improvements on ADE20K, PSPNet produces more accurate and detailed results. challenge 2016. Table 5 shows a few results in this com- petition. Our ensemble submission achieves score 57.21% on the testing set. Our single-model yields score 55.38%, which is even higher than a few other multi-model ensem- ble submissions. This score is lower than that on the valida- tion set possibly due to the difference of data distributions between validation and testing sets. As shown in column (d) of Fig. 2, PSPNet solves the common problems in FCN. Fig. 6 shows another few parsing results on validation set of ADE20K. Our results contain more accurate and detailed structures compared to the baseline. 5.3. PASCAL VOC 2012 Our PSPNet also
