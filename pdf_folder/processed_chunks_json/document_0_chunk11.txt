by phase contrast microscopy (see Figure 4a,b and Supp. Material). It contains 35 partially annotated train- ing images. Here we achieve an average IOU (“intersection over union”) of 92%, which is signiﬁcantly better than the second best algorithm with 83% (see Ta- ble 2). The second data set “DIC-HeLa”3 are HeLa cells on a ﬂat glass recorded by diﬀerential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (see Figure 3, Figure 4c,d and Supp. Material). It contains 20 partially annotated training images. Here we achieve an average IOU of 77.5% which is signiﬁcantly better than the second best algorithm with 46%. 5 The u-net architecture achieves very good performance on very diﬀerent biomed- ical segmentation applications. Thanks to data augmentation with elastic defor- 1 The authors of this algorithm have submitted 78 diﬀerent solutions to achieve this result. 2 Data set provided by Dr. Sanjay Kumar.

We provide the full Caﬀe-based implementation and the trained networks4. We are sure that the u-net architecture can be applied easily to many more tasks.
