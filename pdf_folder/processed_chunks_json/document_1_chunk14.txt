the results in Table 2. The baseline uses ResNet50- based FCN with dilated network, with the master branch’s softmax loss for optimization.

Setting an appropriate loss weight α in the auxiliary branch is important. ‘AL’ denotes the auxiliary loss. Baseline is ResNet50-based FCN with dilated network. Empirically, α = 0.4 yields the best performance. The results are tested on the valida- tion set with the single-scale input. Figure 5. Performance grows with deeper networks. The results are obtained on the validation set with the single-scale input.

Deeper pre-trained model get higher performance. Num- ber in the brackets refers to the depth of ResNet and ‘MS’ denotes multi-scale testing. branch, α = 0.4 yields the best performance. It outperforms the baseline with an improvement of 1.41/0.94 in terms of Mean IoU and Pixel Acc. (%). We believe deeper networks will beneﬁt more given the new augmented auxiliary loss. Ablation Study for Pre-trained Model Deeper neural networks have been shown in previous work to be beneﬁcial to large scale data classiﬁcation. To further analyze PSPNet, we conduct experiments for different depths of pre-trained ResNet. We test four depths of {50, 101, 152, 269}. As shown in Fig. 5, with the same setting, increasing the depth of ResNet from 50 to 269 can improve the score of (Mean IoU + Pixel Acc.) / 2 (%) from
