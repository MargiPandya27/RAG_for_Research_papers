million training images. Since then, even larger and deeper networks have been trained . The typical use of convolutional networks is on classiﬁcation tasks, where the output to an image is a single class label. However, in many visual tasks, especially in biomedical image processing, the desired output should include localization, i.e., a class label is supposed to be assigned to each pixel. More- over, thousands of training images are usually beyond reach in biomedical tasks. Hence, Ciresan et al. trained a network in a sliding-window setup to predict the class label of each pixel by providing a local region (patch) around that pixel arXiv:1505.04597v1 18 May 2015 2 copy and crop input image tile output segmentation map 64 1 128 256 512 1024 max pool 2x2 up-conv 2x2 conv 3x3, ReLU 572 x 572 284² 64 128 256 512 570 x 570 568 x 568 282² 280² 140² 138² 136² 68² 66² 64² 32² 28² 56² 54² 52² 512 104² 102² 100² 200² 30² 198² 196² 392 x 392 390 x 390 388 x 388 388 x 388 1024 512 256 256 128 64 128 64 2 conv 1x1 Fig. 1.

Secondly, the training data in terms of patches is much larger than the number of training images. The resulting network won the EM segmentation challenge at ISBI 2012 by a large margin. Obviously, the strategy in Ciresan et al. has two drawbacks. First, it is quite slow
